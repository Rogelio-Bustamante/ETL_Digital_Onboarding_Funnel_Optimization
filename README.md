# ETL_Digital_Onboarding_Funnel_Optimization
Design and implementation of an ETL pipeline on the Databricks platform, orchestrated with Azure Data Factory, aimed at analyzing and optimizing user behavior during the digital account opening process in a banking application. The objective was to identify drop-off points within the digital funnel and generate insights to improve user-to-active-customer conversion rates.
