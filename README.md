# ETL_Digital_Onboarding_Funnel_Optimization
In this project, I contributed to the design and development of an end-to-end ETL in Databricks, automatically orchestrate within a Job, aimed at analyzing and optimizing the digital onboarding funnel for new banking customers.

The solution focused on analyzing user behavior within a mobile app that enables account opening without visiting a branch. Drop-off patterns, average time per stage, and conversion differences by region and age group were identified. These insights enabled the business to redesign parts of the process to improve conversion rates.

 ### Dashboard

 This funnel chart represents the customer conversion rate by stage, showing that only 75.75% of users completed the registration process to open a bank account through the mobile app.

 ### Automate Workflow

 This job allows us to automatically orchestrate the execution of tasks (ETL processes) defined in the notebooks. It is scheduled to run periodically.
